# 🌟 Substance: A Powerful Library for Cargo-Bloat and More

Welcome to the **Substance** repository! This library enhances your experience with Rust's cargo-bloat tool and provides additional features to optimize your projects. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with Substance, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Blogoag/substance/releases). After downloading, follow the instructions to execute the library and integrate it into your Rust projects.

## 📦 Features

- **Cargo-Bloat Integration**: Analyze your binary size and identify unnecessary dependencies.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Get detailed reports on your project's size and composition.
- **Customizable Options**: Tailor the analysis to meet your specific needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 📚 Installation

To install Substance, you can use Cargo, Rust's package manager. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cargo install substance
```

This command will fetch the latest version of Substance and install it on your system.

## 🛠️ Usage

Once installed, you can start using Substance in your Rust projects. Here’s a simple command to analyze your project:

```bash
substance analyze
```

This command will generate a report on your project's size and dependencies. You can customize the analysis with various flags:

```bash
substance analyze --output-format json
```

This command will output the report in JSON format, making it easy to integrate with other tools.

## 📊 Example

Here’s a basic example of how to use Substance in a project:

1. Create a new Rust project:

   ```bash
   cargo new my_project
   cd my_project
   ```

2. Add Substance as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   substance = "0.1.0"
   ```

3. Use Substance in your code:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       // Your code here
       substance::analyze();
   }
   ```

4. Run your project:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

This will execute the analysis and display the results in your terminal.

## 📈 Understanding the Reports

Substance provides detailed reports that help you understand your project's dependencies and size. The reports include:

- **Total Size**: The total size of your binary.
- **Dependency Breakdown**: A list of dependencies and their sizes.
- **Unused Dependencies**: Identify libraries that are not being used in your project.
